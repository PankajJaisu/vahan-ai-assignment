## Multi-Agent Design

| Agent Name             | Responsibility                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `PaperSearchAgent`     | Searches papers from arXiv by topic             |
| `ExtractionAgent`      | Extracts text from PDF, URL, DOI                |
| `TopicClassificationAgent` | Classifies text using zero-shot classification |
| `SummaryAgent`         | Summarizes long text using transformer models   |
| `AudioAgent`           | Converts summary into podcast-style audio       |

Agents communicate in a pipeline to process and enrich research content.

## Paper Processing Methodology

1. **Input**: URL, PDF, DOI, or academic repository
2. **Text Extraction**: From file or remote link using PyMuPDF or BeautifulSoup
3. **Classification**: Using Hugging Face's zero-shot classification pipeline
4. **Summarization**: Using Facebook's `bart-large-cnn` model
5. **Storage**: Title, summary, topic, source, and audio path saved in DB

---

## Audio Generation

- Uses `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert summaries into `.mp3`
- Includes podcast-style intros and outros for better engagement
- Files are saved and served from `/media/audios/`

---

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Limitations:
- Currently supports only English summaries via gTTS
- Only English supported via gTTS
- Basic citation capture (only arXiv and links)

### Future Enhancements:
- Add support for multilingual summarization
- Integrate speaker voice cloning (e.g., ElevenLabs)
- Add task queues (Celery) for async processing
- Build UI dashboard to explore topics and listen to audio
